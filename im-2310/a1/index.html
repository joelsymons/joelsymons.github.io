          <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
          <p>Given that the page loaded up with a blank canvas, similar to a basic Paint style program, my attention went straight to the buttons along the left side and along the top to see what actions I could take with the canvas.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li> Looked at the side bars</li>
              <li> Clicked on the "Sample Colour" tool</li>
              <li> Tried to choose a colour to draw in (black & and were the default)</li>
              <li> Looked at the toolbar at the top to find a different tool</li>
              <li> Hovered over the button with a paintbrush icon to confirm that it was the paintbrush</li>
              <li> Clicked the paintbrush button</li>
              <li> Drew some lines on the canvas</li>
              <li> Looked at the toolbars again to see if I could change any of the paintbrush settings</li>
              <li> Found a slider bar on the left</li>
              <li> Clicked and dragged the slider on the bar up to see what effect it would have</li>
              <li> Drew more lines and noticed that they were thicker than before</li>
              <li> Looked at the top toolbar again to find other ways of modifying the paintbrush</li>
              <li> Found some tiles with various kinds of dotted patterns on them</li>
              <li> Clicked one of them</li>
              <li> Tried drawing more lines and noticed the lines I drew had the pattern I had just selected</li>
              <li> Looked for the eraser tool and clicked it</li>
              <li> Partially erased some of the squiggles from before</li>
              <li> Selected another pattern tile and clicked it</li>
              <li> Looked at the tool bar for another kind of paintbrush modifier</li>
              <li> Found the Fill tool next to the eraser and clicked it</li>
              <li> Clicked on the outside of the lines I had previously drawn</li>
              <li> Looked for something to change the view of the canvas</li>
              <li> Found some buttons on the left toolbar</li>
              <li> Hovered over the buttons to see their functions</li>
              <li> Clicked the "Recentre" button</li>
              <li> Clicked the "Move View" button</li>
              <li> Clicked and held down on the canvas</li>
              <li> Dragged the canvas around</li>
              <li> Let go of the mouse</li>

            </ol>

          <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
          <p>The paintbrush tool and drawing on the canvas</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
          <p>Clicking and dragging</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
          <p>To provide an extremely simple canvas that a client can use to draw lines or shapes with certain patterns</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
          <p>It doesn't explicitly communicate this goal in any form of explanation, other than the titles of each of the 
            buttons after hovering over them, but I think it makes an assumption that the user has seen a similar canvas format before,
            likely in something like Microsoft Paint, and it keeps

        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
          <p>I think that because the experience is designed for easy and accessible use (and given the nature of it being a blank canvas) it is intended to be interacted with as much or as little as the user desires. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
          <p>The experiences doesn't explicitly describe how it should be interacted with over time, but the one way it does communicate this is with the "File" button in the top left corner, which lets you not only 
            save the image you've created but also import images into the website and it will automatically render them using the program's own patterns and paintbrush styles.</p>
