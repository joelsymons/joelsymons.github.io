  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)

   >> JOEL (( The button not only doesn't look like a button, it gives very vague feedback about whether it's doing what it's meant to be doing.
    >> It isn't clear what's going on on the page unless you wait until it finishes loading. I would recommend implementing something like a
    >> 'loading wheel' or even just some text that says "Loading..." so that the user knows that the page is running properly. Additionally,
    >> if you used a :hover class here on the button so that the text were to change visually when it is hovered over, or if you used an :active
    >> class so the visual changes when clicked, this would also help. It is not intuitive to have bare static text acting as a button with little-to-no 
    >> visual indication that it's a button. ))

  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)

    >> JOEL ((The 'throbber' doesn't seem to do anything visually. It seems as though it is meant to be a progress loading bar but it doesn't progress,
    >> so maybe using a <progress> element instead would help to make it clearer that the page is loading. Otherwise you could use some kind of moving image,
    >> perhaps a .gif file, to show that the page is simply loading and not just being unresponsive.))

  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)

    >> JOEL ((Something like a :hover class here would be beneficial to make it clear that these are in fact buttons to be clicked on. This has the same problem 
    >> of static text not looking like a button by itself. Otherwise the buttons themselves work fine. A good addition would be a "Scroll back to top" button so
    >> that you can quickly jump to and from different sections with ease.))

  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)

    >> JOEL ((The ability to switch from dark mode to light mode and back, with the innerHTML also reflecting this, is a nice touch. However it may initially be
    >> unclear that this is a button, since it doesn't stand out in any way other than its position on the page, and once again when you hover over it there is
    >> no indication that it's a button until you click it.))

  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
  by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

    >> JOEL ((The switch between the light and dark modes is a little abrupt, and it's especially jarring when it's from one extreme of the colour spectrum to the
    >> other. To smooth this transition, we can use a transition CSS property so that it fades from dark to light or vice versa over a short duration instead of being instantaneous.

    >> i.e. in the body text of 'style.css' you could write: 
    
    >> transition: all 0.5s ease;
    
    >> and then to specify which elements you want to change colour (in this case the background and the text), you'd write
    >> h1, button, div, nav {
    >> transition-property: color, background-color, border-color;
    >> }

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
